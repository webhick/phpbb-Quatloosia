# phpbb-Quatloosia
The Quatloosia theme for phpbb
Inherits from the prosilver theme

The _master file in the source directory contains all the graphics for the theme.  You'll need Inkscape to use it properly.  Remember to install the Inkscape slicer extension to allow the exporting of graphics.  Make sure that your slicer layer is not locked when you export or else it might freeze the program.

The forum images are all linked to the master list to the right.  If you change a color, etc on the right, all the forum images will update.

Remember to keep things pixel-perfect.  Otherwise, things get fuzzy.
